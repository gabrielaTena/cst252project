		"“Our page consists of self-expression through a set of symbols. Clothes play an important role in our everyday lives since certain colors, patterns, and accessories can present our backgrounds and personalities. Each possession in your wardrobe signifies a sense of cultural belonging and personal style. On this page, you will discover the art of clothes within the context and components of different aesthetics. There is no right or wrong in the way you express yourself, as long as it’s you."
